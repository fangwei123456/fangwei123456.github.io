I am currently the Postdoc Association in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://seas.yale.edu/departments/electrical-engineering), [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/),  mentored by Prof. [Priya Panda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qA5WsYUAAAAJ&hl=en).

I received my Ph.D. degree in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Yonghong Tian](https://www.pkuml.org/staff/yhtian.html). I closely cooperated with Prof. [Zhaofei Yu](https://yuzhaofei.github.io/) of Peking University, Researcher [Timothée Masquelier](https://cerco.cnrs.fr/pagesp/tim/) of CNRS, and Prof. [Guoqi Li](https://casialiguoqi.github.io/) of Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences during my Ph.D. career.

My recent research interests are learning and network structure of Spiking Neural Network.

Please contact me (fangwei123456g at gmail.com) if you are interested in my research.
